# To-do List

This is a public to-do list that I am using for keeping track of what needs to be done around here for content and meta things. If you want to help out with the project and don't know where to start, check this. Somethings should be reserved for me (xzi, the maintainer), but most things you can take a jab at. When in doubt, ask.

## Meta

- [x] ~~Optimize CI so it doesn't take 2:30+ to build the site~~ (Optimized from [~2:30](https://github.com/xzi/startwriting/actions/runs/9726123914/job/26844209064) to [~0:30](https://github.com/xzi/startwriting/actions/runs/9726272152/workflow))
- [ ] Make a README and contribution instructions
- [ ] Create a Discord server for the project
- [ ] Attributions for plugins
- [ ] Prettify things around the repo

## The actual guide

- [ ] Break down the common things people believe when they say they cannot write
- [ ] Advice on good first projects and what you may eventually want to branch out into
- [ ] Tools to make writing easier
- [ ] Advice on making writing flow
- [ ] Advice on publishing your works freely online
- [ ] Resources to improve your writing on a meta level (I will probably not do this one but it sounds cool in my head so it goes on the list)
