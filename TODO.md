# To-do List

This is a public to-do list that I am using for keeping track of what needs to be done around here for content and meta things. If you want to help out with the project and don't know where to start, check this. Somethings should be reserved for me (xzi, the maintainer), but most things you can take a jab at. When in doubt, ask.

## Meta

- [] Make a proper README
- [] Create a platform for communication (Discord seems the best)
- [] Optimize CI so it doesn't take 2:30+ to build the site
- [] Attributions for plugins
- [] Maybe some nice artwork?

## The actual guide

- [] Come up with a proper draft (probably should've done this before buying the domain)
