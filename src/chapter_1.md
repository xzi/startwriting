A statement easier said than done.  

*This site is in a perpetual state of being WIP. I work on it whenever I remember to. If you want to contribute, feel free to reach out*

Over the years, I have heard many people tell me some variation of the following:

>"I would love to start writing, but *insert thing here* is stopping me!"

This guide was made to try and take out as many of those excuses as possible. While this guide will not turn you into a master writer, it will hopefully give you the motivation to begin writing things of your own.

Writing is an incredibly fun pasttime, and the writer of this guide hopes that you will learn to enjoy it as well, regardless of skill.
