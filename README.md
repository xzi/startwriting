*This guide is very work in progress and is more of a hobby project than a serious thing. Please be patient.*  

Startwrit.ing is a guide for those who are just getting started with creative writing. This repository holds most of the things that make startwrit.ing work.  

If you are interested in contributing, please message @ruckerenum on Discord and I would be happy to give you something to do. Proper contribution guidelines/docs will be coming when I get a chance.
